TRANSFER TIMELINES REFERENCE
============================

This document provides expected processing timelines for all Wealthsimple transfer types. Use this reference when reconstructing a transfer timeline or assessing whether a transfer is overdue.


BANK DEPOSIT (PAD — PRE-AUTHORIZED DEBIT)
------------------------------------------
Expected timeline: 5–7 business days until funds are available for investing or withdrawal.
Processing schedule: PAD deposits are processed 4 times per business day. The exact processing window depends on when the deposit was submitted relative to the daily cut-off times.
Notes:
- Funds may appear in the account balance before they are cleared and available.
- Internal transfers and withdrawals are blocked on deposited funds until the 5-business-day hold clears.
- Large deposits may trigger an extended hold pending fraud review.


INTERAC E-TRANSFER
------------------
Expected timeline: Same business day in most cases; up to 1 business day in rare circumstances.
Processing schedule: Near-real-time when submitted during business hours.
Notes:
- E-Transfer auto-deposit must be enabled on the client's bank account.
- No hold period — funds are available immediately upon receipt.
- Maximum per-transfer limits apply (set by the client's bank, typically $3,000–$10,000 per transfer).


INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNT TRANSFER (RRSP, TFSA, NON-REGISTERED — FROM ANOTHER BROKER)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected timeline: 1–4 weeks under normal conditions.
Extended timeline: Up to 6–8 weeks if the originating institution rejects the initial transfer request and a new request must be submitted.
Processing schedule: Requests are submitted to the originating institution during business hours. The originating institution controls the majority of the processing time — Wealthsimple has no visibility into their internal queue.
Notes:
- Cash and securities may arrive separately.
- Securities that cannot be transferred in-kind must be liquidated first, adding 3–5 business days.
- The transfer status may remain "In Progress" for extended periods while the originating institution processes the request — this is expected.
- See institutional_transfer_process.txt for the full step-by-step process.


WIRE TRANSFER — CANADIAN DOLLARS (CAD)
----------------------------------------
Expected timeline: Same business day if submitted before the daily cut-off time; up to 3 business days otherwise.
Cut-off time: Varies by financial institution; typically mid-afternoon Eastern Time.
Notes:
- Wire transfers submitted after the cut-off are processed the following business day.
- Not all institutions accept incoming CAD wire transfers. Tangerine and Peoples Trust are known to reject incoming wires.
- Wires cannot be reversed once sent — rejections by the receiving institution result in funds being returned, which may take 1–3 additional business days.


WIRE TRANSFER — US DOLLARS (USD)
----------------------------------
Expected timeline: Same business day if submitted before cut-off; up to 3 business days otherwise.
Cut-off time: Varies; typically early-to-mid afternoon Eastern Time for same-day processing.
Notes:
- USD wire transfers are subject to the same cut-off and institutional restrictions as CAD wires.
- Currency conversion (if applicable) occurs at the time of processing and is subject to the prevailing exchange rate.


INTERNAL TRANSFER (BETWEEN WEALTHSIMPLE ACCOUNTS)
---------------------------------------------------
Expected timeline: Usually instant (within minutes).
Auto-cancellation policy: If an internal transfer remains in progress for more than 5 business days, it is automatically cancelled by the system.
Notes:
- Internal transfers of held funds are blocked until the holding period clears.
- If an internal transfer is automatically cancelled, a new transfer must be initiated by the client.
- Internal transfers between registered accounts (e.g., RRSP to TFSA) are not direct — they require a withdrawal and re-contribution, which has tax and contribution-room implications.


WITHDRAWAL TO LINKED BANK ACCOUNT
-----------------------------------
Expected timeline: 1–3 business days after the withdrawal is initiated.
Eligibility requirement: Funds must have been held in the Wealthsimple account for a minimum of 5 business days before they are eligible for withdrawal. This applies to funds received via PAD deposit.
Notes:
- Funds received via Interac e-Transfer do not have this holding requirement and can typically be withdrawn immediately.
- Withdrawals from investment accounts (e.g., selling securities) require the trade to settle (T+1 for equities) before funds can be withdrawn.
- Withdrawals to unverified or newly linked bank accounts may be held for additional review.


BUSINESS DAY DEFINITION
------------------------
A business day is any weekday (Monday–Friday) excluding Canadian statutory holidays. Transfers submitted on weekends or holidays are queued for the next business day.
